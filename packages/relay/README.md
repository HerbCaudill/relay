# üêü relay

This server provides two services:

- **Introduction** (aka discovery): A client can provide one or more document keys that they're
  interested in. If any other client is interested in the same key or keys, each will receive an
  `Introduction` message with the other's id. They can then use that information to connect.

- **Connection**: Client A can request to connect with Client B on a given document ID. If we get
  matching connection requests from A and B, we just pipe their sockets together.

## Running locally

From this monorepo, you can run this server as follows:

```bash
$ yarn start:signal-server
```

You should see something like thsi:

```bash
$ yarn start:signal-server
yarn run v1.19.0
$ yarn workspace relay start
$ node dist/start.js
üêü Listening at http://localhost:8080
```

You can visit that URL with a web browser to confirm that it's working; you should see a big ol' fish emoji:

## Deployment

The easiest way to stand one of these up is to use the [relay-standalone] repo,
which is optimized for deployment. In that repo you'll find instructions for deploying to Heroku,
AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Platform, and Glitch.

## Usage

The client that we've written for this server is the easiest way to use it. See the instructions for
[relay-client] for details.

## API

The following documentation might be of interest to anyone working on `relay-client`, or
replacing it with a new client. You don't need to know any of this to interact with this server if
you're using the client.

This server has two WebSocket endpoints: `introduction` and `connection`.

### Introduction endpoint: `/introduction/:localId`

- I connect to this endpoint, e.g. `wss://your.domain.com/introduction/aaaa4242`.

  - `:localId` is my unique client identifier.

- Once a WebSocket connection has been made, I send an introduction request containing one or more
  document IDs I'm interested in joining:

  ```ts
  {
    type: 'Join',
    join: ['happy-raccoon', 'hairy-thumb'], // documents I have or am interested in
  }
  ```

- If another peer is connected to the same server and interested in one or more of the same
  documents IDs, the server sends me an introduction message:

  ```ts
  {
    type: 'Introduction',
    id: 'qrst7890', // the peer's id
    keys: ['happy-raccoon'] // documents we're both interested in
  }
  ```

- I can now use this information to request a connection to this peer via the `connection` endpoint:

### Connection endpoint: `/connection/:localId/:remoteId/:key`

Once I've been given a peer's ID, I make a new connection to this endpoint, e.g.
`wss://your.domain.com/connection/aaaa4242/qrst7890/happy-raccoon`.

- `:localId` is my unique client identifier.
- `:remoteId` is the peer's unique client identifier.
- `:key` is the document ID.

If and when the peer makes a reciprocal connection, e.g.
`wss://your.domain.com/connection/qrst7890/aaaa4242/happy-raccoon`, the server pipes their sockets
together and leaves them to talk.

The client and server don't communicate with each other via the `connection` endpoint; it's purely a
relay between two peers.
